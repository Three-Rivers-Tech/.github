# 🏙️ Three Rivers Tech, LLC

**Affordable technology, built with hometown pride in Turtle Creek, Pennsylvania.**

At Three Rivers Tech, we believe world-class technology doesn’t have to come with world-class prices.  
From a century-old building at **124 Grant Street**, we design, host, and maintain modern digital systems for small businesses, creators, and neighbors who just want tech that works — and people who actually pick up the phone.

## 💡 What We Do

| Service | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Website Development & Hosting** | Custom websites built, maintained, and hosted in-house. You own your business — we handle your code, uptime, and updates. |
| **Networking & IT Services** | Local and remote IT setup, data backups, security hardening, and managed systems — reliable without the corporate markup. |
| **AI & Automation Solutions** | Smart tools and machine-learning systems designed to simplify workflows and boost efficiency for small and midsize companies. |
| **Hardware & Infrastructure** | GPU clusters, Proxmox virtualization, and hybrid cloud deployments — right here in Turtle Creek, not in someone else’s “cloud.” |

We run our own servers, manage our own network, and keep your data under local stewardship — **no outsourcing, no guessing, no nonsense.**

## 🌼 The Building & The Blend

Our space at **124 Grant Street** isn’t just racks and routers.  
The first floor is shared with a creative partner — **Penrose Floral & Apotheca** — bringing the same craftsmanship and attention to detail that we bring to code. Upstairs is a working studio and home, proof that *technology and community can thrive under one roof.*

We call it *industrial warmth*: copper wire meets ivy.
